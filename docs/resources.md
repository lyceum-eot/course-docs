## Assigments

Weekly assignments are provided to the students for them to better understand, and also get their feet wet by solving and practice what is being taught.

For weekly assignments we're using _**[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/)**_.

Assignment workflow:
* Assignments will be provided with a boilerplate code.
* Students upon accepting the invitation of the assignment, GitHub classroom automatically creates a repo for them.
* After which the students need to solve the assignment using online code editors or on their local repos.
* At last, the instructors would evaluate the assignment and provide remarks.

## Forum

The forum is used for issues pertaining a specific problem or an error faced by a student. Where one can share the issue, and the instructors or other community members address them.

_**[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org)**_ is one such Open Source platform that we've setup for the same.

## Chat Application

The students and the instructors can collectively use the chat app for general discussions regarding any topic in Computer Science. Thereby keeping in touch with the students, and effectively communicate with one another.

For the same _**[Zulip](https://zulipchat.com)**_, an Open Source real-time chat application is being used.

## Material Sharing & Online Editors

The complete materials for the coursework is being shared using _**[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)**_. It is similar to Jupyter Notebooks.

* Using which one can access the content of the coursework.
* It serves as an online code editor, where one can write and execute Python programs.
